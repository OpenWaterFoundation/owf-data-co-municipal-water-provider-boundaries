# data-orig

This folder contains data from original sources that had to be manually accessed.
Copies are saved here to ensure that the full workflow can be run.

Folders are created using OWF identifiers for water providers,
with dated folders indicating the date when a dataset was downloaded.

Ideally, all data from original sources should be published in a way that allows direct download
without manual intervention.
